# Pond     ![fish-sprite-2](https://github.com/francescaguzzi/pond/assets/76923530/1826ea71-c4d8-44d7-a282-7d8f13d2fd51)

It's like playing pong, but you're a fish. Built in Unity engine.

This game was developed as a first approach to Unity development during my university internship. I had to develop the classic pong game, but i wanted to give some kind of personal touch to it so I took advantage of the similarity between the words "pong" and "pond", resulting in two koi carps playing with a pebble in a lily pond. 
I made the graphics in Procreate and Aseprite, taking inspiration from Claude Monet's various lilies paintings. 
The game is playable on your browser [here](https://hydrangeax.itch.io/pond).
This is a very small project, but i hope you enjoy it!
